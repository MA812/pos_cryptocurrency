# Context

Hello everyone,

Over the years, I have personally created comprehensive solutions to meet the needs of a growing market.

Unfortunately, these solutions have not been as commercially successful as hoped, which is why I am now making these proofs of concept available. (I personally hope that you will take advantage of them rather than right-clicking -> trash).



If you feel so inclined, you can make a donation to me as an example (paypal.me/MAndono).

Wishing you every success in your business endeavors,
Sincerely,
L>M>A



# Explanations
This service allows you to receive cryptocurrency payments at a physical point of sale. Currently, only Monero and Bitcoin are supported.
Multiple points of sale can be created on a single account. You can adjust the speed/relevance of this solution by changing the number of verifications for a received transaction.
You will need to list your node addresses, as well as your CoinLayer key (to obtain cryptocurrency prices and perform conversions). The Cron task must be executed every 10 minutes.

Please note, however, that this code can be adjusted according to your needs/experience.
